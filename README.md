# OSORM 🚀
Introducing OSORM, the only Open-Source Organisation Relationship Manager you'll ever need. 

## Introduction and Backstory 📖
Welcome to OSORM, your all-in-one solution for efficient organization management. Founded by @arashnrim and @pengsies, OSORM is the culmination of our diverse tech backgrounds, extensive involvement in multiple (tech-related, of course 😉) special interest groups (SIGs), and roles within executive committees of SIGs. Drawing from our collective experiences, we've created OSORM, a platform that simplifies the complexities of organizational management and empowers the next generation of organization/community leaders.

## What is OSORM? 🌐
**OSORM**, short for **Open-Source Organisation Relationship Manager**, revolutionizes the way you interact with and manage your organization. Designed for self-hosting, our platform empowers leaders, offering seamless integration with your organization's structure and member relationships, allowing you to carry out your leadership responsibilities while reducing overall administrative efforts. 🤝


## OSORM Branches 🌿
In many projects that I use, I have a habit of setting up structured branches in order to facilitate a more streamlined Continuous Development (CD). Here are the branches OSORM uses:

- `main`: This branch contains the last completed and tested version of the project, which is considered stable and ready for use. It represents the production-ready code and should be used as the base branch for deployments. Only well-tested and reviewed changes are merged into this branch to ensure the reliability and stability of the project.

- `devtest`: This branch is the development and testing branch where all concurrent code resides. It is used for ongoing development and integration of new features and enhancements. However, it may contain incomplete or experimental code that is still being worked on. It is not recommended to use the code from this branch directly as it may be unstable and may not function as expected.

- `hotfix`: This branch is specifically used to address critical bugs or issues that have been identified in the `main` branch. It is created from the `main` branch to fix urgent issues and ensure timely resolution. The code in this branch focuses solely on fixing the identified problem and is thoroughly tested before merging it back into the `main` branch. It helps maintain the stability and integrity of the production code.

- `mainmerge`: This branch is created to facilitate the merging of changes into the `main` branch due to security measures put in place to protect the `main` branch. It serves as an intermediate branch where pull requests are made from other feature branches or development branches. The purpose of this branch is to consolidate and review the changes before merging them into the `main` branch. It allows for thorough testing, code reviews, and validation of the proposed changes to ensure they align with the project's standards and requirements. The `mainmerge` branch helps maintain the integrity and reliability of the `main` branch by providing a controlled and structured approach to merging updates.
